I did database host on phpmyadmin.

Firstly, we have to import the documents.sql file to the phpmyadmin localhost.

After linking the the .sql file, we can execute the code to run and perform the task.

To start with, firstly open the main.html file and after that by clicking the dropdown menu
we can perform the add, edit, update and delete task which is linked with the database.
